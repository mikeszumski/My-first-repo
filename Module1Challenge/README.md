### When was the company incorporated?
Began as brokerage service division of ADP in 1962.  Became independent in 2007. ADP itself started as Automatic Payrolls, Inc in 1949.  To quote Wikipedia,
>Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. is a public corporate services and financial technology company founded in 2007 as a spin-off from management software company Automatic Data Processing. Broadridge supplies public companies with proxy statements, annual reports and other financial documents, and shareholder communications solutions, such as virtual annual meetings.

### Who are the founders of the company?
Automatic Payrolls Inc was founded by Henry Taub in Roseland, NJ.  Frank Lautenberg, former senator from New Jersey, became a partner in 1957.

### How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?  
Like IBM, ADP rode the crest of computer innovation to automate non-manufacturing business functions, which had been done by hand.
Broadridge Financial Solutions focuses on automating securities processing and providing software and services to large securities firms in the US and Canada.

### How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
Broadridge went public in 2007 and is now listed in the S&P 500.  Their shares are traded publicly, and they borrow on public markets extensively.

## Business Activities

### What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Broadridge seeks to improve client revenues and reduce risk by offering tools to access market data integrated with the client's own proprietary data, and extract business insights.
Recently, Broadridge sought to provide to their clients a natural language interface to the LLM which was trained on the sort of data used by fixed income professionals.  

### Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
Broadridge's customers are brokerages and other securities firms, ranging in size from medium to huge.

### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
This solution is the first of its kind to be used by fixed income traders, account managers and operations staff.  It is patent-pending. But no doubt their competitors are hot on their heels with their own solutions.

### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
The BondGPT product is a generative LLM, built on ChatGPT-4.  The model undergoes additional domain-specific training.  A large body of bond-related data is integrated into the model.  The model can be tailored to the client needs and preferences, which influence the model's responses to user queries.  Conveniently, the product is integrated into Broadridge's bond trading platform.

## Recommendations

### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
Suggest tools for internal use, such as 
- An LLM based on ChatGPT with additional training in company specific data and practices.  Sort of an assistant to the employees.  The tool would be capable of generating often-used communications using standard templates tailored to the needs of the audience, be that a client or an internal team.
- A code and product maintenance LLM to support queries about a specific product and the code and data underlying it.  Particularly useful for products based on old mainframe code and data for which documentation is time-consuming to access.

### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
- the first is a productivity enhancer.
- The second will improve productivity, reduce risk and improve customer service to those clients who rely on the products.

### What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
LLM, additional subject-area training.

### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
These technologies are proving their worth across the spectrum of industries. Why is that?  **_Because they are cool!_**
